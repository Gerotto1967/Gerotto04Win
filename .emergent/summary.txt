The trajectory details an intensive, iterative development process for an ERP application. Initially, the AI engineer (E1) faced confusion due to a vague problem statement (olá) and a perceived reset of previously implemented features by the user, leading to a re-implementation of core ERP functionalities (login, dashboard, clients, products, finance, XML processing, simulated Upseller integration). This re-implementation was confirmed functional as Phase 1.

Following this, the user clarified numerous advanced requirements, including multi-CNPJ management, sophisticated inventory control (e.g., average cost, stock adjustments, returns, general deposit for marketplaces), complex financial reconciliation, detailed expense tracking, advanced UI patterns (inline editing, customizable screens, cumulative filters), granular user permissions, and specific fiscal rules (ICMS differential). The AI meticulously documented these requirements with detailed mockups and descriptions, culminating in a comprehensive ERP specification.

A critical point emerged regarding marketplace integration: the user stated no API was available for Upseller. This led to a re-evaluation of the integration strategy, moving towards semi-manual processes based on spreadsheet imports. The user then provided a reference ERP (GestãoClick) for comparison, which the AI analyzed against the gathered requirements, highlighting our project's unique enhancements. The final active task is to implement a robust Company/CNPJ registration module to replace mock data and integrate with the existing multi-CNPJ stock system, for which the user approved the 76-credit budget. The trajectory concludes with a user query about the database type, implying a potential misalignment (MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL).

<product_requirements>
The user needs a fully functional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system tailored for multi-CNPJ operations.
**Core Modules:**
1.  **Authentication:** Login with /, JWT-based.
2.  **Dashboard:** Overview with key statistics (clients, products, revenue, expenses, balance).
3.  **Clients:** CRUD operations, search, filters, customizable columns.
4.  **Suppliers:** Basic CRUD, historical purchases, payment terms.
5.  **Products/Stock:**
    *   Single product registration with multiple stock locations (5+ CNPJs), displaying individual CNPJ stock and a consolidated total.
    *   Separate stock for accounting per CNPJ, grouped for marketplace feed.
    *   General Deposit table to feed marketplaces, lowering stock from both specific CNPJ and general deposit upon sale.
    *   Two cost fields: Valor Pago (last paid) and Custo Médio (average cost, for marketplace feed).
    *   Detailed movement history (non-editable) per product, accessible via right-click, with filters (date, CNPJ, type) and dynamic totalizers.
    *   Adjustments (entry/exit/transfer), sales returns (stock + financial reversal), purchase returns (stock + financial reversal).
    *   Image field for products, displayed in search results.
6.  **Financial:**
    *   Unified Accounts Payable/Receivable module with a switch button.
    *   Support for multiple bank accounts/cash (Caixa).
    *   Reconciliation: ERP balance must match real bank balance.
    *   Expense tracking integrated into Accounts Payable, with historical categories (e.g., rent, energy).
    *   Annual expense entry with installments (e.g., energy in 12x), for forecasting.
    *   XML processing: Upload XML, auto-parse, create accounts payable, and apply specific fiscal rules.
7.  **Marketplace Integration (Semi-manual):**
    *   No direct API integration with Upseller/Shopee/Mercado Livre (due to API unavailability).
    *   **ERP to Marketplace:** Export products for manual upload, manual price/stock updates.
    *   **Marketplace to ERP:** Import sales reports (e.g., Shopee Excel), process sales, auto-lower stock, create accounts receivable, calculate real profitability (using marketplace's net profit report).
8.  **Multi-CNPJ Management:** Single login to access all associated CNPJs, with quick switching and optional consolidated views.
9.  **User Management:** Control users with granular permissions by modules and functions (CRUD), and per CNPJ. Flexible profile creation based on templates.
10. **UI/UX:**
    *   Totally editable fields, inline editing (click to edit, tab/click-out to save, ESC to cancel).
    *   Standardized 2-screen pattern: 1st screen for search/listing, 2nd for detailed view/edit/add.
    *   All screens customizable: draggable columns, show/hide fields, saved layouts.
    *   Cumulative filters with visual indicators and dynamic totalizers.

**Additional Desired Features (Future Phases):** Advanced managerial reports (profitability, ABC analysis, stock turnover, demand forecast), intelligent alerts (stock minimum, old products, due accounts), fiscal/tax control (ICMS differential 6% rule on XML import into cost), advanced stock (lots, traceability, kits, reservations), security (backup, audit log), predictive analysis (sales forecast, purchase optimization).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: FastAPI (backend), React (frontend).
- **Database**: MongoDB (currently configured, user implies PostgreSQL was agreed).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Data Handling**: Multi-CNPJ support, XML parsing for invoices.
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Inline editing, customizable tables (drag & drop columns), cumulative filters.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

**File Summaries & Changes:**
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core backend application file. It was initially a basic FastAPI app. It was completely rewritten to implement Phase 1 features: authentication, JWT, MongoDB models and APIs for Clients, Suppliers, Products (with multi-CNPJ stock, average cost logic), Finance (accounts, banks), XML processing (with ICMS differential rule), and a simulated Upseller integration. It defines the API contract for the frontend.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies. , , , , , To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]",  were added or ensured for the robust ERP backend.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component. It was updated to handle routing for the new ERP modules (Dashboard, Clientes, Produtos, Fornecedores, Financeiro, etc.) and integrate the main layout structure.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css & /app/frontend/src/index.css**: These CSS files were updated to include Tailwind CSS directives and global styles for the new ERP UI.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/*.js**: Multiple React components were created for each module (e.g., , , , , , , , ). These files encapsulate the UI and interaction logic for their respective modules, adhering to the specified UI/UX patterns like inline editing and customizability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a Company/CNPJ registration module. This module will allow the user to dynamically create, read, update, and delete company entities, replacing the currently mock 5 CNPJs. The goal is to integrate this new module with the existing multi-CNPJ stock system, allowing stock to be managed per registered company. The AI had already confirmed that 76 credits were sufficient for this specific task and stated it would proceed. The last action indicates an edit was successful, implying the implementation of this module is underway or just completed in the backend, but not yet fully integrated or tested. The user also raised a question about the database in use (MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL), which remains unaddressed.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the newly implemented Company/CNPJ registration module into the frontend.
